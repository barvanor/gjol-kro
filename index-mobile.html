        <p class="paragraph">We - myself Peter and my fiancée Natazja
        leased the inn back in March 2020, with the
        vision of making the inn a sort of gathering
        place for all. A place where groups both large
        and small can enjoy a meal and also guests
        who just want to drink a cold beer in the bar
        area. It's not just for town locals, but also for
        guests from out of town.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">We want to emphasis our creativity when it
          comes to giving a modern twist to classic Danish
          recipes, as well as taking advantage of local and
          seasonal ingredients. The menu will vary depending
          on what raw goods are available during the season.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">Our vision is for the inn to once again become
          an integrated part of the local community, but
          also an experience guests from all of
          Nordivlland will want to have. Between the
          sunroom and the main room, we can house
          150 seated quests. We can hold different
          types of events, including parties, weddings,
          milestone birthdays, confirmations and much
          more. Gjøl Kro is a place where groups both
          large and small can enjoy a meal and also
          guests who just want to drink a cold beer in
          the bar area. It's not just for town locals, but
          also for quests from out of town.</p>

          <h2 class="heading">Our history</h2>
          <p class="paragraph">The historical inn dates all the way back to 1851,
            when it had a thatch roof and served as the
            town's gathering point. Unfortunately, it burned
            down around 1900 and was rebuilt the year after,
            giving it its current form with stepped gables. The
            gables are easily seen from the Limfjord and can
            be used as a sort of sea mark that tells sailors
            that they have arrived in Gjøl.
            The inn is also where Hans Kirk wrote his novel
            "The Fishermen" (Danish; Fiskerne), describing
            the conflict between the residents of Gjøl and a
            group of newcomer fishermen.</p>
